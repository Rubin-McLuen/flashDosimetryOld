    "The beam dimensions are being varied by steps of 5 for both the height and width. Since we want every width to have every height nested for loops were used. Inside the loops a function from the module sys is being utilized, `sys.call`. `sys.call` allows a command from the terminal Ex. `ls`, `cd`, `sed`, and `grep` to be issued in another process. This allows me to use the math and logic of Python to cleanly impliment the looping then use the terminal's `sed` command to change a pattern of text in the run.mac file to what I need it to be.\n",

    "`sed` is a tool developed for text manipulation of files. It is **extremely** fast and light weight. It is also a product of the early days of computing so following with sterotypes it is 'clunky and fragile' to use. I will walk you through what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First:\n",
    "`sed` stands for \"stream editor\" which makes sense since all it does is edit sequences of text in streams. `sed -i` tells `sed` to do its thing **Inline**. Normally it would \"open\" the file to memory, do its edits on the file in memory then print it out to standard out or the user would redirect the printing to another file. This is useful but not what we want, we want the file to be edited right then and there.\n",

    "`s:` stands for substitution, `sed` matches patterns of text based on **regular expressions**. The pattern following `:` is the pattern being looked for, the `.*` matches any amount of any character its a super wild card. The stuff following the second `:` is what the first pattern will be replaced or substituted with.\n",
    "- This is where Python makes this easy, I'm using an fstring to create a string and put the value of the variable width divided by 2 and with 2 decimals in the location it appears in the string. I get easy formatting and string manipulation unlike bash\n",
